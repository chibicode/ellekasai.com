title: Practicing Sketch

<div class="alert alert-warning">This post is a work in progress :)</div>

I spent the last few days practicing **<a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/" target="_blank">Sketch</a>**. I followed the tutorials by Jean-Marc Denis on **<a href="http://sketchdesign.io/" target="_blank">SketchDesign.io</a>**.

Here are the sketches I made, with my own tweaks. I didn't spend much time on each one, so these are more of a rough sketch than a polished one.
