title: Practicing Sketch
---


I spent the last few days practicing **Sketch**. I followed the tutorials by Jean-Marc Denis on **<a href="http://sketchdesign.io/" target="_blank">SketchDesign.io</a>**.

Here are the sketches I made, with my own tweaks. I didn't spend much time on each one, so these are more of a rough sketch than a polished one.
