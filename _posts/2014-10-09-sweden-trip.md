In the second week of September this year, I traveled in Sweden, Italy, and Germany with my boyfriend for a week. 

First I’d like to talk about our trip in Sweden. We visited Stockholm city and stayed there for 2 days. The city has  beautiful architecture and I enjoyed the scenery very much. 

## 1st day

We arrived at Arlanda Airport on the evening of September 6th. Then we proceeded to our hotel to check-in and went sightseeing right away.

### Sergels torg

Sergels torg is the central part of the city. There are some museums and shops around here.

### Stockholm City Hall

Stockholm City Hall is worth visiting. This is the venue for Nobel Prize Party. I was surprised that there is a room named “Golden Hall” which is decorated with real gold.

### Vasa Museum

Vasa is a ship made in the 17th century. Sadly, this ship sank on her first voyage. But after Vasa was salvaged, engineers reassembled and reconstructed the ship. You can see this gorgeous and spectacular ship in this museum.
